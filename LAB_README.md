# Todo Single Page App Lab


The goal of this lab is to implement ajax requests within a single page app.

Fork the application in this repo and add delete and update functionality to the app.  The update functionality only needs to update the completed attribute of the todo item.  This requires changes both in the rails app and in the javascript.

## Hints

* Run the specs for the rails app, ```bundle exec rspec spec```.  Look at what the tests are testing for.  If you understand the tests, creating the rails app will be easier.

* Look at the comments in the todos.js file.  They give some hints on where to put some of the code.
